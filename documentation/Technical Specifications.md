## DATABASE DESIGN

Microsoft Excel will use a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to store different types of data efficiently. The primary databases will be:

1. Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for structured data:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ WORKBOOK : owns
    WORKBOOK ||--|{ WORKSHEET : contains
    WORKSHEET ||--|{ CELL : contains
    CELL ||--o| FORMULA : may_have
    CELL ||--o| STYLE : has
    WORKBOOK ||--o{ NAMED_RANGE : contains
    WORKBOOK ||--o{ MACRO : contains

    USER {
        string id PK
        string email
        string name
        datetime created_at
    }
    WORKBOOK {
        string id PK
        string name
        string owner_id FK
        datetime created_at
        datetime modified_at
    }
    WORKSHEET {
        string id PK
        string workbook_id FK
        string name
        int order
    }
    CELL {
        string id PK
        string worksheet_id FK
        int row
        int column
        string value
    }
    FORMULA {
        string id PK
        string cell_id FK
        string expression
    }
    STYLE {
        string id PK
        string cell_id FK
        json properties
    }
    NAMED_RANGE {
        string id PK
        string workbook_id FK
        string name
        string range
    }
    MACRO {
        string id PK
        string workbook_id FK
        string name
        text code
    }
```

2. Google Cloud Firestore for real-time collaboration and document-based data:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Workbooks Collection] --> B[Workbook Document]
    B --> C[Metadata]
    B --> D[Sheets Collection]

  return (
    <div className="overflow-auto">
      <table className="border-collapse">
        {data.map((row, rowIndex) => (
          <tr key={rowIndex}>
            {row.map((cell, colIndex) => (
              <td key={colIndex} className="border border-gray-300 p-1">
                {cell.value}
              </td>
            ))}

      <input
        type="text"
        value={formula}
        onChange={(e) => setFormula(e.target.value)}

        <FormattingOption label="Font" />
        <FormattingOption label="Size" />
        <FormattingOption label="Color" />
        <FormattingOption label="Alignment" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

5. Chart Creation Dialog
```tsx
const ChartDialog: React.FC = () => {
  const [chartType, setChartType] = useState('bar');

  return (
    <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-lg">
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Create Chart</h2>
      <select
        value={chartType}
        onChange={(e) => setChartType(e.target.value)}
        className="w-full p-2 border border-gray-300 rounded"
      >
        <option value="bar">Bar Chart</option>
        <option value="line">Line Chart</option>
        <option value="pie">Pie Chart</option>
      </select>
      <div className="mt-4">
        <button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
          Create
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The UI components will be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. For mobile devices, a simplified interface with essential features will be provided. The design will follow Microsoft's Fluent Design System guidelines while leveraging Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and customization.

Accessibility features will be implemented throughout the UI, including proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and high-contrast modes for users with visual impairments.

This system design provides a solid foundation for building a modern, scalable, and user-friendly version of Microsoft Excel using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Python for backend services, and Google Cloud solutions for infrastructure and data storage.
