This data model represents the core entities in Microsoft Excel and their relationships. It provides a foundation for implementing the various features and functionalities of the application.

## DATA STORAGE

Microsoft Excel will utilize a combination of local storage and cloud-based storage solutions to ensure data integrity, accessibility, and scalability.

### Local Storage

For desktop applications (Windows and macOS):
- Files will be stored in the XLSX format, which is based on the Office Open XML standard.
- Temporary files and auto-recovery information will be stored in a designated local directory.

For mobile applications (iOS and Android):
- Files will be stored in the app's sandboxed storage area, following platform-specific best practices.
- A local SQLite database will be used for managing file metadata and recent file lists.

### Cloud Storage

Google Cloud Storage will be used as the primary cloud storage solution for Excel files:

1. Bucket Structure:
   - Each user will have a dedicated bucket for their Excel files.
   - Shared files will be stored in separate buckets with appropriate access controls.

2. File Versioning:
   - Google Cloud Storage's built-in versioning will be enabled to maintain file history.
   - A maximum of 100 versions per file will be retained.

3. Data Redundancy:
   - Files will be stored using the "Multi-Regional" storage class to ensure high availability and redundancy across multiple geographic regions.

4. Access Control:
   - Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) will be used to manage access permissions for files and buckets.

### Data Retention

1. Active Files:
   - Files will be retained indefinitely as long as the user's account is active.
   - Users will have the option to manually delete files.

2. Deleted Files:
   - Deleted files will be moved to a "Trash" folder and retained for 30 days before permanent deletion.
   - Admins will have the ability to recover deleted files within this period.

3. Inactive Accounts:
   - Files belonging to inactive accounts (no login for 2 years) will be flagged for potential archival or deletion.

### Backup and Recovery

1. Cloud Backup:
   - Full backups of all user data will be performed daily using Google Cloud Storage Transfer Service.
   - Incremental backups will be performed every 6 hours.

2. Retention of Backups:
   - Daily backups will be retained for 30 days.
   - Weekly backups will be retained for 3 months.
   - Monthly backups will be retained for 1 year.

3. Recovery Process:
   - A automated recovery system will be implemented using Google Cloud Functions to restore files or entire user accounts.
   - Recovery can be initiated by users for individual files or by admins for larger restore operations.

4. Disaster Recovery:
   - A complete disaster recovery plan will be implemented using Google Cloud's cross-region replication features.
   - Regular disaster recovery drills will be conducted to ensure the effectiveness of the recovery process.

## DATA PROCESSING

Data processing in Microsoft Excel involves various operations on user data, including calculations, transformations, and analysis. The following measures will be implemented to ensure secure and efficient data processing:

### Data Security

1. Encryption:
   - All data in transit will be encrypted using TLS 1.3.
   - Data at rest will be encrypted using Google Cloud KMS (Key Management Service).

2. Access Control:
   - Fine-grained access control will be implemented using Google Cloud IAM.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to manage user permissions within the application.

3. Data Isolation:
   - User data will be logically isolated using Google Cloud's VPC Service Controls.

4. Audit Logging:
   - All data access and modifications will be logged using Google Cloud Audit Logs.

5. Secure Computation:
   - Sensitive calculations will be performed in isolated environments using Google Cloud Confidential Computing.

### Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the high-level data flow within the Microsoft Excel ecosystem:

4. Analysis and Machine Learning:
   - Advanced data analysis and machine learning capabilities will be provided through integration with Google Cloud AI Platform.

5. Real-time Collaboration:
   - Real-time data synchronization will be implemented using Google Cloud Firestore for live collaboration features.

6. Caching:
   - A multi-level caching strategy will be implemented using Redis for frequently accessed data and calculation results.

7. Data Export/Import:
   - A robust import/export service will be developed to support various file formats, ensuring data interoperability.

By implementing these data requirements, Microsoft Excel will provide a secure, scalable, and efficient platform for handling diverse data processing needs while ensuring data integrity and user privacy.
