# HUMAN ASSISTANCE NEEDED
# The following test cases might need more specific implementation details:
# - Test for real-time collaboration
# - Test for conflict resolution
# - Test for version history
# These features might require more complex setup and mocking of WebSocket connections or database interactions.

    # Implement test for real-time collaboration

def test_conflict_resolution():
    # Implement test for conflict resolution
